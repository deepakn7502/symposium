            <p className="gt"> GUIDELINES</p>• One team per college.<br></br> • Each team will
            be given a topic ,where the two different company's output or
            products will be given.
            <br></br>• Your team has to infuse or integrate both the products of
            different company and prepare an advertisement regarding your hybrid
            product. <br></br>• For example, if the topic is Dairy Milk and Boat
            Earbuds: U have to explain how u combine both the products into an
            interesting product and make an advertisement regarding the product.
            <br></br> • After each and every team receives their respective
            topics.<br></br> • Only a hour will be provided to prepare your plan
            to advertise your product. <br></br>• At that span of time, each
            team has to prepare and then record their advertisement (Done
            through speech, U can also make use of props like charts, art
            whatever u need , and everything needs to be recorded properly).
            <br></br> • Recorded video must be sent within a hour.<br></br>• The
            recorded video must be within minimum 2 minutes to maximum 5
            minutes, more than that is not advisable ( Make it crisp and catchy,
            cause no one likes to watch ad for more than a minute..cause we
            obviously know more duration makes ad boring, So try not to be
            boring).<br></br> • Recorded content must have clear audio and
            (video) and interference during the recording is not appreciated.
            <br></br> • The about mentioned are some major etiquette to be
            followed. <br></br>• Team which doesn't stick to the above mentioned
            points will be strictly disqualified.
